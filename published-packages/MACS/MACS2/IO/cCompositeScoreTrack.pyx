class compositeScoreTrackI:
    """Class for composite scoreGraph type data. Modified from
    bedGraphTrackI. The only difference is that we store pvalue score,
    qvalue score and foldchange together.

    In bedGraph, data are represented as continuous non-overlapping
    regions in the whole genome. I keep this assumption in all the
    functions. If data has overlaps, some functions will definitely
    give incorrect results.

    1. Continuous: the next region should be after the previous one
    unless they are on different chromosomes;
    
    2. Non-overlapping: the next region should never have overlaps
    with preceding region.

    The way to memorize bedGraph data is to remember the transition
    points together with values of their preceding regions. The last
    data point may exceed chromosome end, unless a chromosome
    dictionary is given. Remember the coordinations in bedGraph and
    this class is 0-indexed and right-open.
